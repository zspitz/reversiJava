This is a Reversi game written in Java.

No UI beyond the console, and there are a few missing parts.

Beyond an intro to Java for me, I had two goals:

* Separation of game logic from rendering
* Rerender on each state update

I'd written a previous version in [JavaScript](https://github.com/zspitz/reversiJs) along the same lines.
